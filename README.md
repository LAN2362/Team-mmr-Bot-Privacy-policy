# Team-mmr-Bot-Privacy-policy

This privacy policy shall be accepted by the server and its members who use Team mmr Bot#2784 (991719449373720587). This document does not supersede the [Developer Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal).

### Data sent by command

The following items may be collected and sent if you knowingly provide them (on command): This data is not collected automatically.
* Discord ID
* Role name, ID
* All the above in the server

### Data Storage

The transmitted data will not be output to a log or otherwise saved. It is automatically deleted when the program has finished processing.

In addition, the server running the bot can only be SSH-connected by [Taiscale](https://tailscale.com/), and we take all possible measures to ensure security, including the management of that account. Note that even with these protections, no data is 100% secure. While every effort is made to keep your data safe and private, its absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

### Agreement

In addition, you (the server administrator) agree to notify Members of the Developer Terms of Service and the contents of this document. If you, the server administrator, disagree with this document, you can remove the bot from your server. If you, as a server member, do not agree to this document, you may leave the server containing the bot. If you, the service user, do not agree to this document, you can un-approve the application in the Approved apps menu.
